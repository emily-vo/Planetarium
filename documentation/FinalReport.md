 # Final Report: CIS 700 Final Project
**Team**: Andrea Lin, Suzanne Knop, Emily Vo

## Design Doc
### Introduction
What motivates this project?
* A cool way to combine all of the skills we acquired over the course of the last few weeks (Noise, Shaders, Animation). 
* It’ll challenge us to make really complex, detailed, and accurate environments into a modular world. 
* It’s pretty cool. It’s a good way to showcase our individual aesthetics and technical skills, but with our unified theme and focus on transitions, we will have a pretty polished final product.
### Goal
Create a group of related environments that is altered based on music data in the shader. We are planning to modularize the project by creating separate assets, which will be joined together in the end to create unique planets. These unique planets will be animated in interesting ways, using the music data to drive the animation.  We will transition between them.
### Inspiration/reference
* [Worlds in Worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzsG1uqfDTQ)
* [CGI Procedural Animated Short HD: "De Planeta" by Leonardo Cavaletti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qARpMpHskTM)
* [Super Mario Galaxy Nintendo Wii Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmN8DHZYNCg)

### Specification
* Procedural Asset Generation - modularized components will be built that can be easily spawned and combined with others to create interesting environments for each planet (e.g. flowers, terrain, rocks, clouds, buildings)
* Music Visualization - animated planet features based on music (color, movement, shape)
* Transitions between planets - camera animation

### Techniques
* L-systems/grammar rules to populate environment
* Music visualization techniques
* Camera transformations for transitions
* Shaders for animation and transitions

### Design
  * Program Flow
  * Team Work Flow
### Timeline
**Week 1 (4/18)**  
**Group goal:**  
Have framework completed with modularized code for each world and their assets. Want to make it easy to reuse assets and add to them, while also making it easy to generate new and interesting planets. The framework will be focused on also making sure that animating things based on music and time will be easy. We will also begin working on assets and aim to have at least one of them complete for each person in our group. We also want to create our transitions between each world. We want to present the framework, assets, and transitions in class.

**Suzanne:**
* Audio extraction and analysis: use the Web Audio API to load and extract data from an audio mp3 file. Analyze the amplitute( volume) data and make it accessible through a function.
